## Summary

Given the fec16 package, developed by Prof Ben Baumer, Rana Gahwagy, Irene Ryan, and Marium A. Tapal from Smith College, we were tasked to "follow the money" and make sense of the data given to us. 

When "following the money" we saw many relationships, but we decided to focus on the impact of different committees in the 2016 Presidential Election. Since this election was incredibly important, we wanted to know how each of the main parties, Democrat and Republican, received funding especially in the key "swing" states. Thus, our main question is: How did committees from the swing states contribute to the parties in the 2016 presidential election? 

## Comparing Contributions in 2016 Presidential Election in the Swing States (With and Without Virginia)

When analyzing the contributions data set, specifically focusing on the swing states, we found an outlier: Virginia. Virginia, a Democrat leaning state, seemed to have contributed a significant amount of money that greatly alters the data if we removed it. As can be seen in the visualization, if Virginia is included, Clinton received more money, around $60,000,000 which is almost double Trump's contributions. Without Virginia, Trump received more money, with Trump receiving a little more than double of Clinton's contributions. This means, that the committees in Virginia played a significant role in contributing money to the presidential candidates. 

According to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/virginia), the 13 electoral college votes of Virginia went to Clinton , with more of the big cities and populated areas voting blue. The graph provided (with Virginia) shows that there is a relationship between the amount of committee contributions to how the state votes. Furthermore, more committees are situated in the big cities, who voted blue (can be seen NYC Times article), such as Fairfax, Loudoun, and Falls Church. Another relationship to note is that, according to [abc8news](https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/list-these-are-the-counties-in-virginia-with-the-highest-median-income-chesterfield-powhatan-hanover-goochland-crack-top-25/), the top three richest counties in VA are: Loudoun, Falls Church, and Fairfax. These being the richest counties can correspond to them voting Democrat in the election, and also contributing a significant amount of money that pushed Clinton to have more contributions during the Presidential Race.

## Comparing Contributions in the Last 6 Months of the 2016 Presidential Race in the Swing States

This visualization focuses on the distribution of money donated by the committees during the last 6 months of the 2016 Presidential election. We can see that in the beginning of May 2016 more donations were made towards the Republican Party. There is, however, a spike in contributions towards the Democratic Party around June. 

Contributions between the month of July and October varied, with peaks for both Republicans and Democrats. There is staggering in contributions for both and becomes more apparent at the end of the dataset. This might be primarily caused by election day being on November 8th, and as the end of the elections approaches, people's desire for a specific party to win strengthens. The committees who are contributing money might have seen the winning projections, and wish to change the race by putting more money towards certain parties. 

Key points are the peaks, specifically November 1st, October 21st, and October 5th. For October 21st, [270towin](https://www.270towin.com/news/2016/10/21/electoral-college-projections-as-of-october-21st_399.html) reports that Clinton was projected to win, and that her lead increased by 12 (Clinton having 304 while Trump had 179 electoral college votes). With this future projection, more committees might have decided to contribute money to continue her push towards presidency. A similar situation might have happened on November 1st. As for the peak of Trump's contribution, on October 5th, a [vice presidential debate]( https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/opinions/pence-kaine-debate-reaction-roundup/index.html) occurred on this day in which most predict Mike Pence won, and this might have led to this sudden increase in contributions.


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, include=FALSE}

# gets transaction_amt, filter to Trump(P80001571) & Clinton(P00003392)
contributions_sum <- contributions %>% 
  group_by(cand_id, state, transaction_dt) %>% 
  summarise(new_transaction = sum(transaction_amt))  %>% 
  filter(cand_id == "P80001571" | cand_id == "P00003392")

# new table: only contributions for last 6 months in swing states
transactions_sixmonths <- contributions_sum %>% 
  inner_join(candidates, by = "cand_id") %>% 
  select(cand_id, state, new_transaction, transaction_dt) %>% 
  filter(state == "WI"|state == "PA"|state =="NH"|state == "AZ"|state == "GA"|
           state =="FL"|state == "MN"|state == "MI"|state == "NV"|
           state == "CO"|state == "NC"|state == "ME"|state == "VA") %>% 
  subset(transaction_dt > "2016-05-08" & transaction_dt <= "2016-11-08")

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# visualization: 
ggplot(transactions_sixmonths, aes(x = transaction_dt, y = new_transaction, 
                                   colour = cand_id))+
  geom_line()+
  scale_color_manual(values=c("blue", "red"),labels = c("Democrat", "Republican"),  
                    name = "Party")+
  labs(y = "Money Contributed", x = "Month in 2016",  
       title = "Committee Contrbutions for the Last 6 Months of Presidential Election") 

```


## Looking at the Bigger Picture

From analyzing both data visualizations given, we can see that the Democrats received much more funding in the swing states, especially Virginia. The swing states play a significant role in determining the winner, and the results were split, with half voting Democrat and the other half Republican, according to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/president). Overall, although the Democratic party received more funding from the provided committees, the Republican party still won the presidential election. However, the state of Virginia, who donated a large sum of money, did vote Democratic this election year. Therefore, we can conclude that more money doesn't necessarily lead to winning, as can be seen from our visualizations and the results of the Presidential Election.
